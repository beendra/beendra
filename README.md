## Hello, hi! :sparkles:

I'm Alex, my pronouns are she/her, and I am a current, about-to-graduate, full-time Software Engineering student at Flatiron School. I am a former bartender/bar manager who is making the pandemic pivot into tech! An excellent problem solver, multitasker and team player skilled in interpersonal communication. Bringing that tenacity into my coding I get a real thrill out of squashing bugs and jumping hurdles.
